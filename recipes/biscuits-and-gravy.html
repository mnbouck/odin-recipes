        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Biscuits and gravy can be broken down into two essential components: fluffy, warm buttermilk biscuits, sliced down the middle, and thick, salty sausage gravy. Like most traditional renditions, this recipe uses pork sausage to add flavor and texture to the gravy, but you can substitute with any kind of ground sausage, from chicken to turkey.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16.3 ounce) can Southern-style flaky refrigerated biscuits </li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package maple-flavored breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Arrange biscuits on a baking sheet spaced about 1 1/2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 13 to 17 minutes. Slice in half crosswise; keep warm.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, crumble sausage into a large skillet over medium heat; cook, breaking sausage apart, until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle sausage and pan drippings with flour; cook and stir until sausage coated, about 1 more minute. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Stir in evaporated milk, followed by milk until thoroughly combined; bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, until desired thickness, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper; stir in butter until melted. Stir in more flour if gravy isn't thick enough.</li>
            <li>Serve biscuits, cut sides up, topped with sausage gravy.</li>
        </ol>
